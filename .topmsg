Subject: [PATCH] lazy

Use Data.Text.Lazy (not to choke on huge inputs,
and be able to incrementally give results).

Explanation -- from the docs of Data.Text.Lazy:

The representation used by this module is suitable for high
performance use and for streaming large quantities of data. It
provides a means to manipulate a large body of text without requiring
that the entire content be resident in memory.

Some operations, such as concat, append, reverse and cons, have better
time complexity than their Data.Text equivalents, due to the
underlying representation being a list of chunks. For other
operations, lazy Texts are usually within a few percent of strict
ones, but often with better heap usage if used in a streaming fashion.
For data larger than available memory, or if you have tight memory
constraints, this module will be the only option.
